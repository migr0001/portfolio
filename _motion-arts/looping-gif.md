description: "When Things Just Don't Go Right"

about: |
  As a Graphic Designers, we have no choice but to be in front of the screen for hours and hours. Your laptop can be a friend in the Design career, but it can also be your enemy when something doesn't go right.

inspiration: |
  I've been there. Sitting on my laptop for hours and pulling all nighters to complete several tasks. When you don't get the results you hope for, or when you're having a creative block, you can feel frustrated to say the least. In these situations, coffee can be your best friend.

plan: |
  I decided to take out my frustrations on pencil and paper, and roughly sketch what I was experiencing at the time as my laptop refused to work. The scenario that you see played out in the video was exactly how I reacted when my laptop decided to shut down while I was working.


goals: |
  This negative experience I had turned out to be one of my favourite motion pieces. Let this be a lesson to you. Always have a pencil and paper by your side, cause you never know when you'll be inspired to create **relatable**.
