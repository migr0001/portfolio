about: |
  One of the many stereotypes of Aquarius people is that they are confidently weird. Friends love their eccentricities and originality.

inspiration: |

  As someone who doesn’t believe in astrology, it’s a lot of fun to research and educate myself on other people’s beliefs. From the online research and the podcasts I frequently listen to, I gathered a general idea of Aquarius’ personality. I wanted to mainly highlight their eccentric and confidently weird personality.

plan: |
  The more simple the character graphics are, the easier it is to animate in After Effects. With that said, sketching and vectorizing the character didn’t take long to do. I searched for an audio that I thought would perfectly describe just how odd Aquarius’ are.


conclusion: |
   I was impressed with how fast the planning process took. Although this project would normally take three weeks to build, this project took me 3 days to complete.
