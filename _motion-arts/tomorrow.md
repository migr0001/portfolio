about: |
  This is a short kinetic typography to a relatable, yet inspirational song
  called “Tomorrow.” The songwriter and rapper (stage name SUGA) talks
  about young adults (specifically those in their 20’s) being insecure about
  their future. Although working hard towards their goals and passion can be
  exhausting, the rapper is still optimistic in his lyrics, telling people to follow
  their dreams even though it may be tough.

inspiration: |

  The band Bangtan Sonyeondan (famously known as BTS) is a South Korean
  group that is being compared to the Beatles with their enormous fan base
  around the world. They are also known to be socially conscience group
  Their lyric topics mainly highlight not only their personal struggles, but also
  relatable subject matter that young adults may face on a daily basis. These
  topics include: mental health, the rough journey towards self-appreciation,
  pressures from society, empowerment, and many more. Their message of
  self love and confidence even though one may be different from everyone
  else is spread through their music. The band mentions that the goal of
  their music is to share their story and to help those going through the
  similar situations. As a fan, I admire them for using their platform to spread
  inspiring messages.

plan: |
  Although the South Korean band sings and raps in their native language, their fanbase is enormous and globally spread despite the language barrier. The translated lyrics was easy to find on dedicated fansites willing to spread BTS’ message in various languages. However, trying to make the translated english lyrics sync up to the Korean audio seemed difficult at first. I wanted to challenge myself to not only do a kinetic typography to a language that is foreign to me, but also visually communicate their story.


conclusion: |
   I am proud with how it turned out, as the simple kinetic typography visually tells a relatable story of youths who are insecure of the future.
