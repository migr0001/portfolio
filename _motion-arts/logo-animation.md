about: |
  This is a simple 10 second video of my logo animation, MADesigns. This took a full day to plan and complete in After Effects. I wanted to make the animation simple, yet fun, as every movement matches to the beat to Alan Walker's catch hit song, "**Faded**".

inspiration: |
  During the summer break, I started to create a variety of different motion graphics pieces that I could include in my portfolio. I got bored and decided to start branding myself. Before I start to brand myself, I knew I needed a logo. This is where the planning begins...

plan: |
  One of my nicknames is *“Mad”*. I assume it’s because it’s the first three letters of my name, Madelaine, and one syllable less than my common nickname “Mad-die”. Family members also tease that I’m more creative when I’m in an angry mood, as I take out all of my frustrations on pencil and paper. With that said, I thought it would be fitting to combine **MAD** with **Designs**, as I am passionate about what I do.

  I sketched out possible ideas for my logo. I ended up with a simple “M” and “D” design. However, when the M and D are put together, the letter A forms in between them as I extended the top of the letter D. Now, we have the letters M, A, and D for the logo.

  Lastly, I wanted to come up with a simple acronym that would best represent me as a designer for the three letters. I concluded that my designs are **Memorable** and **Accessible Designs**.

conclusion: |
  The goal is to get some exposure, and confidence with my skills in motion graphics. I’ve received great feedback from curious viewers on some of videos, which pushed me to do even better for the next upload. I added this logo animation to my home on my YouTube channel, where I upload my best motion graphic pieces. When curious viewers go to my page, this logo animation automatically plays. This video welcomes viewers with a catchy beat. They get to know about me and why I upload videos in just 10 seconds.

  As previously mentioned, I animated my logo and text to the beat of Alan Walker’s hit song, **Faded**. To view my other logo animation with Billie Eilish’s song “Bad Guy”, please click on the link below:
