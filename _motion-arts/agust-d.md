description: "The Last • Kinetic Typography"

about: |
  I wanted to highlight mental health, an important topic which unfortunately is still considered a stigma in today’s society. This is only a short preview of a 3 minute kinetic typography to the song “The Last” by a rapper named Suga (aka Agust D). He addresses the monster named “fame” which negatively impacts his “mental pollution”.
