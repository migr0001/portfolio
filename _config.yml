      The default layout should be used for almost every page, it includes the website's primary header & footer.

    Welcome to my portfolio website!
  font_url: "https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Indie+Flower|Nunito+Sans:400,400i,700,700i,900,900i&display=swap"
  colors:
    background: "--color-secondary"
    accent: "--color-neutral-beige"
  rationales:
    typefaces.primary: |
      The primary typeface (Nunito Sans) was chosen because it is a font that is easy to work with with different weights.
    typefaces.secondary: |
      The secondary typeface (Indie Flower) was chosen primarily for the biography section. I wanted the biography page to be more personal using a handwritten font.
    colors.primary: |
      The primary dark blue colour is used for the banner, or for the footer. However, this may change later throughout the semester. The light blue colour is used as a button hover colour against a dark background.
    colors.secondary: |
      The secondary colour is pure white. This will be used as a background colour for the website.
    colors.neutral: |
      The neutral colour is used as a background around texts (for example, the biography page, and description for art).
