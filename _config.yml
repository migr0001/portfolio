    Welcome to my portfolio website!
  font_url: "https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Indie+Flower|Nunito+Sans:400,400i,700,700i,900,900i&display=swap"
  colors:
    background: "#fff"
    accent: "--color-primary"
  rationales:
    typefaces.primary: |
      The primary typeface (Nunito Sans) was chosen because it is a font that is easy to work with with different weights.
    typefaces.secondary: |
      The secondary typeface (Indie Flower) was chosen primarily for the biography section. I wanted the biography page to be more personal using a handwritten font.
    colors.primary: |
      The primary dark blue colour is used for the banner, or for the footer. However, this may change later throughout the semester. The light blue colour is used as a button hover colour against a dark background.
    colors.secondary: |
      The secondary colour is pure white. This will be used as a background colour for the website.
    colors.accent: |
      These colours are the accent colours. After visitors of the website clicks on the hamburger icon once located on the header (on smaller screen sizes), the hamburger icon animation will turn red to allow users to close the nav links. The red is to be used sparingly. The green is used as a background for the carousels.
    colors.neutral: |
      The neutral colour is used as a background around texts (for example, the biography page, and description for art).
