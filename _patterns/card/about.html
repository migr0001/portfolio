    <p class="indie-flower">I’m the only artist in the family. Passion for art was never in my blood. Instead, this passion within me developed as a toddler, painting the night sky almost every night. Something about moving my hand across the page silenced me, almost in a therapeutic way. My parents realized I was gifted in another form of art. <b>Dance</b>. I’ve always loved how my body would instantly react when a certain song comes on, feeling free. Every movement was unplanned, but somehow it served a purpose; to make people smile.</p>
    <p class="indie-flower">Now, as a Graphic Designer, I get to combine the two together using my love for creative activity and adding movement to it. Just like dancing, I create with a purpose. I want to inspire people to take action, and sometimes highlight important topics through motion graphics.</p>
